# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase selected projects, technical experience, and design approach as a software engineer.

The site is implemented as a modern, high-performance single-page application using React and TypeScript, with Vite for fast development and optimized builds. Tailwind CSS is used for consistent, utility-first styling, while Motion is leveraged to add subtle, purposeful animations that enhance user experience without sacrificing clarity or performance.

The portfolio focuses on clarity, responsiveness, and maintainability, highlighting both engineering depth and attention to detail. It is designed to be lightweight, accessible, and easy to extend as new projects and features are added.
